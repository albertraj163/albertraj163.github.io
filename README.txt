READY-TO-UPLOAD PORTFOLIO SITE
------------------------------

Files created in this package:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- assets/Albert_Raj_Resume.pdf  (copied from your uploaded CV)
- assets/profile.jpg (placeholder - replace with your real photo)

HOW TO USE:
1. Replace assets/profile.jpg with your actual profile photo file (same name).
   - If you attached a photo earlier, download it and rename to 'profile.jpg' then overwrite this file.
2. Preview locally: open index.html in a browser.
3. To publish on GitHub Pages (recommended):
   - Create a new repo named: <username>.github.io  (e.g., albertraj163.github.io)
   - Upload all files (root files and assets folder) to the repo (main branch).
   - Go to Repo -> Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from: main branch -> / (root)
   - After a minute, your site will be live at https://<username>.github.io
4. If you prefer to use a different repo (not username.github.io) enable Pages from main branch and use the provided link from GitHub.
5. Confirm links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email) are correct in index.html and change if needed.

If you want, I can:
- Customize the text (bio, title, project descriptions) further.
- Directly upload to a GitHub repo for you (if you provide repo access or do it and tell me steps).
- Add contact form functionality with Netlify/Formspree (optional).
